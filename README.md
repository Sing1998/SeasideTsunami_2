# Capstone: Seaside Tsunami Simulation

This project simulates a tsunami that might happen in Seaside, Oregon. The tsunami simulation is implemented in Unreal Engine 4 with real geographic data. The goal of this project is to help geographic scientists visualize their research in a realistic virtual geographic environment with real geographic datasets. The visual experience will be improved due to the use of realistic visualization techniques and the effective ingestion of real geographic data sets. Because this project generates a scalable workflow, it can reduce the time cost of geographic visualization.
